pro_noun_she_ace_on
===================
A project developed during the Thessaloniki Hackathon organised by the Memrise team, in June 2013.

The target of the application is to teach Greek words to foreigns, based on the way the Greek words sound, and associating them with English words.

The main algorithm is divided in 2 parts:
1) Convert the Greek word into a form using the latin letters and can be pronounced as correctly as possible.
2) Finding English words based on a dictionary, that sound like the converted Greek word.

The implementation is based on Ruby1.9, PHP, JS and jQuery library.
